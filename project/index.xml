      <description>Andrea Vanags (av29824) Introduction: The two datasets I have chosen for this project contain information about suicides and earthquakes worldwide from 1985 to 2016. The suicides dataset contains qualitative (ex: sex, age, generation, countries) and quantitative data (ex: year, number of suicides, country population, gdp for year and per capita). The earthquakes dataset countains mostly quantitative values (ex:date, longitude, latitude, depth, magnitude), some qualitative (ex: ID, status, type) and quite a few N/As.</description>

      <description>0. Introduce your dataset and each of your variables in a paragraph. What are they measuring? How many observations? The &#39;HealthInsurance&#39; dataset including info from the the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey conducted in 1996 was recovered from the AER package. This dataset contains 8,802 observations on 11 variables, but the variables I will be focusing on are: age, gender, education, family, ethnicity, married, insurance, and health. The wrangled dataset was renamed as &#39;data2&#39; and it contains 1,258 rows (observations) for 8 columns.</description>
