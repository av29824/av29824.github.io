Still here?? Nice. 

Let's look at how we can use R and Python together without wanting to tear your hair out in frustration: reticulate.

```{r}
#R-code chunk
library(reticulate)

lookalike <- "who is dr. woodward's celebrity look-alike?"
```

```{python}
#python code chunk
one= "brian david gilbert"
two= "and mathew gray gubler"

#access R-defined objects with r.

print(r.lookalike,one,two)
```

Like... even the glasses are similar I swear...
